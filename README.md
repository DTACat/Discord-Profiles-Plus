### This is a remake of [Custom Effects And Decorations](https://github.com/DTACat/Custom-Effects-And-Decorations-Discord-Theme) but more advanced.

### Basicly it's [Fake Profile Themes](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/tree/main/src/plugins/fakeProfileThemes) if it was for Profile Cosmetics, and was only developed in css.

### Due to the limitations of css, this theme requires at least Discord Nitro Basic to work.

# How To Use

## Join on of the Discord servers below:

### (Server Invites coming soon)

## Put an emoji in your About Me.

What Profile Cosmetics you want on, depends on what emojis you put in your About Me.

## Then bam, you're finished.

# F&Q

## Can other people see my profile cosmetics?

### Yes, Anyone with this theme on will be able to see your profile cosmetics on your profile.

## Can I use this on my Custom Server Profile?

### Yes, this does work with Custom Server Profile if you want different cosmetics for your profile on that server.

## Why not make this a Plugin?

### I don't know how to make Discord Plugins.

## Why can't I use Springtoons?

### 1: The Effects are buggy. 2: They ugly.
